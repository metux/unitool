Universal Toolchain Wrappers
-----------------------------

This is a little toolkit that provides an platform-independent
command line and API for calling toolchain commands (compiler,
linker, etc), including an simple libtool emulation.

Porcelain scripts are yet missing (coming soon), but unitool is
already used by treebuild (http://repo.or.cz/w/treebuild.git)


Build/Install:

    * `ant compile` compiles the unitool.jar file and places it
       under ./build/
    * `ant install` installs it to $HOME/.jar
